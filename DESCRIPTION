Description: Shed light on black box machine learning models by the help
    of model performance, variable importance, global surrogate models,
    ICE profiles, partial dependence (Friedman J. H. (2001)
    <doi:10.1214/aos/1013203451>), accumulated local effects (Apley D. W.
    (2016) <arXiv:1612.08468>), further effects plots, scatter plots,
    interaction strength, and variable contribution breakdown (approximate
    SHAP) for single observations (Gosiewska and Biecek (2019)
    <arxiv:1903.11420>). All tools are implemented to work with case
    weights and allow for stratified analysis. Furthermore, multiple
    flashlights can be combined and analyzed together.
