# Documentation and minor fix release

- This release adds two vignettes. One about caret, the other about mlr3. 

It's the first time I release a package with more than one vignette, so not sure if I got everything right.

- Got rid of a depreciation warning from ggplot2.

- Bug fix in light_effects and light_profile regarding the case where user specified row indices are passed together with pre-calculated predictions.
